**NOTE**: Installing the gems on a windows machine is much easier as MacOS does not give the user write permissions for the bundled version
  of Ruby Apple has installed.
If you really want to run the game on MacOS you will have to modify pathing and install files using homebrew.
    1. First, make sure you are not using Apples bundled Ruby.
      - Open Terminal and run: xcode-select --install
          - Follow the prompts to install the Command‑Line Tools (this gives you git, make, clang, etc.).
      - Run the Homebrew Installer
        - In the same Terminal window, paste this and press Enter:
           - /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
             - This will download and install Homebrew under /usr/local (Intel Macs) or /opt/homebrew (Apple Silicon).
      - Add Homebrew to Your Shell’s PATH
        - At the end of the installer, it will print the commands you need to add to your shell startup file. For zsh (the default on recent macOS) 
          you’ll typically run:
          - echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile
            eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
          - If you’re on an Intel Mac, replace /opt/homebrew with /usr/local.
    2. With Homebrew installed you can now install chruby and ruby-install to use non-Apple bundled versions of Ruby.
          - Run the following in the terminal window you will be using to play the game:
            - ruby-install ruby 3.1.3
              - This will compile and put Ruby in /opt/rubies/ruby-3.1.3
          - Now activate the new version of Ruby with chruby:
            - Make sure you’ve added to your shell startup (~/.zshrc):
              - source /usr/local/opt/chruby/share/chruby/chruby.sh
                source /usr/local/opt/chruby/share/chruby/auto.sh
          - Then simply run:
            - Chruby 3.1.3 (Or whichever version of Ruby you chose to install)
            - Use 'which ruby' to double check which version you are currently installing
    3. You should now be able to successfully install gems on your MacOS system.


Install the 'curses' gem, the 'levenshtein' gem, and the 'yaml' gem
  - The 'curses' gem is the TUI library used to organize and illustrate the terminal.
  - The 'levenshtein' gem is required to handle regex logic.
  - The 'yaml' gem is required to import many of the games settings, items, enemies etc. from an external file to improve readability.

    To install these gems simply run the following commands in your terminal within the directory containing the game file:
      - gem install curses
      - gem install levenshtein
      - gem install yaml

    The game cannot run without these gems installed.

After installing the required gems simply type 'ruby creativeProgram.rb' in your terminal and if the gems were installed correctly
the game should begin to run in your terminal window.
